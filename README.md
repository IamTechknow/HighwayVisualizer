## Call to Action
### Summary 
Visualize your state's highway system and record your own travels

### Problem
Mapping tools such as Google Maps allow one to see highway numbers and routing but generally do not allow one to save various paths one has travelled on.

### Solution
This path visualizes highways from GIS data, allows one to save their own paths, and show an animation of these paths, essentially a map diary.
